- **Scenario**: Design a simplified database schema for managing products, customers, orders, and order items.
- **Database Schema Design**: Includes tables for Products, Customers, Orders, and OrderItems with respective attributes.
- **Tasks**: Cover DDL, DML, and DQL operations ranging from table creation, data insertion, updates, deletions, to complex queries for data retrieval and analysis.

### Part 2: Postgres Server Integration

- **Objective**: Understand the application of SQL in a server-based database system, exploring advanced features and differences from SQLite.
- **Setup**: Install and configure PostgreSQL, recreate the SQLite schema in PostgreSQL, and perform advanced SQL operations.
- **Advanced Tasks**: Explore PostgreSQL-specific features, complex join operations, and utilize transaction controls for data integrity.
- **Deliverables**: Include SQL scripts for both SQLite and PostgreSQL, demonstrating key concepts and operations, alongside a comparative analysis of both databases.
