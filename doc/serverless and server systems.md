# Serverless and Server based architecture 

Server offer both compute resources (CPU, memory, etc) and storage (Hard disk or SSD)

* In server-based system, you need to provide and manage your servers to run your application.
You manage infrastructure including hardware, operating system, networking, and scaling
Example; On-premise data center, Virtual Machine.
- Microsoft SQL Server, 


* In serverless systems; cloud providers provide and manage servers while you run your code in response to incoming requests or events.
Example; AWS Lamda, Azure Functions, GC Functions
- Amazon Redshift
