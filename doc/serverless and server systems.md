# Serverless and Server based architecture 

Server offer both compute resources (CPU, memory, etc) and storage (Hard disk or SSD)

* In server-based system, you need to provide and manage your servers to run your application.
You manage infrastructure including hardware, operating system, networking, and scaling
Example; On-premise data center, Virtual Machine.
- Microsoft SQL Server, 


* In serverless systems; cloud providers provide and manage servers while you run your code in response to incoming requests or events.
Example; AWS Lamda, Azure Functions, GC Functions
- Amazon Redshift

## SQLite and PostgreSQL 

 SQLite is a lightweight and serverless database suitable for small-scale applications and embedded systems, while PostgreSQL is a robust and server-based RDBMS designed for enterprise-level applications with high concurrency and scalability requirements. The choice between them depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the application, performance needs, and deployment environment.
